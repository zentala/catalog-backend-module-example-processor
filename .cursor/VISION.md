# Vision: catalog-backend-module-example-processor

- **Primary Goal:** To create a **canonical, standalone Backstage catalog processor module** that serves as a **fundamental educational tool** and a **robust starting point** for developers (especially juniors) learning to extend the Backstage backend. It should also serve as a **code reference** for advanced users and **LLM models** learning about Backstage.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Code Clarity:** Emphasis on readable, well-commented TypeScript code adhering to Backstage best practices.
  - **Testability:** Code design should facilitate straightforward unit and integration testing.
  - **Example Completeness:** Demonstrate key aspects of processor creation: module definition, `CatalogProcessor` interface implementation, interaction with core services (Config, Logger, Integrations), configuration handling, entity filtering (`Location`), **emission of example entities** based on analysis, and error handling.
  - **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between Backstage integration logic (`processor.ts`) and business/analysis logic (`analyzer.ts`).
  - **Documentation:** Maintain high-quality `README.md` and code documentation (JSDoc), explaining not just _how_ the code works, but _why_ (Backstage context).
  - **Ease of Adaptation:** The structure and code should allow for easy copying and adaptation (`copy-paste development`) to specific user needs.
  - **Self-Containment:** The module should be as self-contained as possible, with its own Git repository, to facilitate reuse and demonstration.
- **Target Users:** Backstage developers (especially newcomers to the ecosystem), DevEx Architects seeking examples, Teams needing to build custom catalog processors, LLM Models.
- **Long-Term Goal / Aspiration:** Inspire the community to create their own extensions. Potentially **transfer maintenance** of this reference example to the Backstage community or a related organization (e.g., within CNCF) to ensure its long-term relevance and alignment with best practices.
- **Additional Goal:** Demonstrate skills and promote good practices within the Developer Experience (DevEx) domain.
